.TH OUTB 2 1995-11-29 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
outb, outw, outl, outsb, outsw, outsl,
inb, inw, inl, insb, insw, insl,
outb_p, outw_p, outl_p, inb_p, inw_p, inl_p \- port I/O
.SH DESCRIPTION
This family of functions is used to do low-level port input and output.
The out* functions do port output, the in* functions do port input;
the b-suffix functions are byte-width and the w-suffix functions
word-width; the _p-suffix functions pause until the I/O completes.
.LP
They are primarily designed for internal kernel use,
but can be used from user space.
.\" , given the following information
.\" in addition to that given in
.\" .BR outb (9).

You compile with \fB\-O\fP or \fB\-O2\fP or similar.
The functions
are defined as inline macros, and will not be substituted in without
optimization enabled, causing unresolved references at link time.

You use
.BR ioperm (2)
or alternatively
.BR iopl (2)
to tell the kernel to allow the user space application to access the
I/O ports in question.
Failure to do this will cause the application
to receive a segmentation fault.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.BR outb ()
and friends are hardware-specific.
The
.I value
argument is passed first and the
.I port
argument is passed second,
which is the opposite order from most DOS implementations.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

This page is part of release 3.27 of the Linux
.I man-pages
project.

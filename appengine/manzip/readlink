.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR readlink ()
places the contents of the symbolic link
.I path
in the buffer
.IR buf ,
which has size
.IR bufsiz .
.BR readlink ()
does not append a null byte to
.IR buf .
It will truncate the contents (to a length of
.I bufsiz
characters), in case the buffer is too small to hold all of the contents.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.BR readlink ()
returns the number of bytes placed in
.IR buf .
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
(See also
.BR path_resolution (7).)
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I buf
extends outside the process's allocated address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I bufsiz
is not positive.
.\" At the glibc level, bufsiz is unsigned, so this error can only occur
.\" if bufsiz==0.  However, the in the kernel syscall, bufsiz is signed,
.\" and this error can also occur if bufsiz < 0.
.\" See: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.man/380
.\" Subject: [patch 0/3] [RFC] kernel/glibc mismatch of "readlink" syscall?
.TP
.B EINVAL
The named file is not a symbolic link.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
A pathname, or a component of a pathname, was too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
4.4BSD
.RB ( readlink ()
first appeared in 4.2BSD),
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
In versions of glibc up to and including glibc 2.4, the return type of
.BR readlink ()
was declared as
.IR int .
Nowadays, the return type is declared as
.IR ssize_t ,
as (newly) required in POSIX.1-2001.

.TH SET_THREAD_AREA 2 2008-11-27 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
set_thread_area \- Set a Thread Local Storage (TLS) area
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B #include <linux/unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <asm/ldt.h>
.sp
.BI "int set_thread_area(struct user_desc *" u_info );
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR set_thread_area ()
sets an entry in the current thread's Thread Local Storage (TLS) array.
The TLS array entry set by
.BR set_thread_area ()
corresponds to the value of
.I u_info\->entry_number
passed in by the user.
If this value is in bounds,
.BR set_thread_area ()
copies the TLS descriptor pointed to by
.I u_info
into the thread's TLS array.
.PP
When
.BR set_thread_area ()
is passed an
.I entry_number
of \-1, it uses a free TLS entry.
If
.BR set_thread_area ()
finds a free TLS entry, the value of
.I u_info\->entry_number
is set upon return to show which entry was changed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR set_thread_area ()
returns 0 on success, and \-1 on failure, with
.I errno
set appropriately.
.SH "ERRORS"
.TP
.B EINVAL
\fIu_info\->entry_number\fP is out of bounds.
.TP
.B EFAULT
\fIu_info\fP is an invalid pointer.
.TP
.B ESRCH
A free TLS entry could not be located.
.SH "VERSIONS"
A version of
.BR set_thread_area ()
first appeared in Linux 2.5.29.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.BR set_thread_area ()
is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are intended
to be portable.
.SH NOTES
Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call;
call it using
.BR syscall (2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"

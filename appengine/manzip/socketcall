.TH SOCKETCALL 2 2007-06-28 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
socketcall \- socket system calls
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "int socketcall(int " call ", unsigned long *" args );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR socketcall ()
is a common kernel entry point for the socket system calls.
.I call
determines which socket function to invoke.
.I args
points to a block containing the actual arguments,
which are passed through to the appropriate call.
.PP
User programs should call the appropriate functions by their usual names.
Only standard library implementors and kernel hackers need to know about
.BR socketcall ().
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
This call is specific to Linux, and should not be used in programs
intended to be portable.
.SH NOTES
On a few architectures, for example ia64, there is no
.BR socketcall ()
system call; instead
.BR socket (2),
.BR accept (2),
.BR bind (2),
and so on really are implemented as separate system calls.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR accept (2),
.BR bind (2),
.BR connect (2),
.BR getpeername (2),
.BR getsockname (2),
.BR getsockopt (2),
.BR listen (2),
.BR recv (2),
.BR recvfrom (2),
.BR recvmsg (2),
.BR send (2),
.BR sendmsg (2),
.BR sendto (2),
.BR setsockopt (2),
.BR shutdown (2),
.BR socket (2),
.BR socketpair (2)

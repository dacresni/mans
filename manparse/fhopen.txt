     The file specified by the given file handle is opened for reading and/or
     writing, as specified by the argument _f_l_a_g_s; the file descriptor is
     returned to the calling process.

     This system call is restricted to the super-user and is used by an NFS
     server's rpc.lockd(8) daemon to open a file in order to perform locking
     operations on it.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is
     returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     ffhhooppeenn() fails if one or more of the following are true:

     [ESTALE]		The file handle no longer refers to a valid, NFS-
			exported object.

     [EPERM]		The caller is not the super-user.

     [EINVAL]		There was a problem with the value of one of the argu-
			ments.

     [EFAULT]		_f_h_p points to an invalid address.

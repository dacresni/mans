     RReeaadd() attempts to read _n_b_y_t_e bytes of data from the object referenced by
     the descriptor _f_i_l_d_e_s into the buffer pointed to by _b_u_f.  RReeaaddvv() per-
     forms the same action, but scatters the input data into the _i_o_v_c_n_t
     buffers specified by the members of the _i_o_v array: iov[0], iov[1], ...,
     iov[iovcnt-1].  PPrreeaadd() performs the same function, but reads from the
     specified position in the file without modifying the file pointer.

     For rreeaaddvv(), the _i_o_v_e_c structure is defined as:

	   struct iovec {
		   char   *iov_base;  /* Base address. */
		   size_t iov_len;    /* Length. */
	   };

     Each _i_o_v_e_c entry specifies the base address and length of an area in mem-
     ory where data should be placed.  RReeaaddvv() will always fill an area com-
     pletely before proceeding to the next.

     On objects capable of seeking, the rreeaadd() starts at a position given by
     the pointer associated with _f_i_l_d_e_s (see lseek(2)).  Upon return from
     rreeaadd(), the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually read.

     Objects that are not capable of seeking always read from the current
     position.	The value of the pointer associated with such an object is
     undefined.

     Upon successful completion, rreeaadd(), rreeaaddvv(), and pprreeaadd() return the num-
     ber of bytes actually read and placed in the buffer.  The system guaran-
     tees to read the number of bytes requested if the descriptor references a
     normal file that has that many bytes left before the end-of-file, but in
     no other case.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     If successful, the number of bytes actually read is returned.  Upon read-
     ing end-of-file, zero is returned.  Otherwise, a -1 is returned and the
     global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     The pprreeaadd(), rreeaadd(), and rreeaaddvv() calls will succeed unless:

     [EAGAIN]		The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data
			were ready to be read.

     [EBADF]		_f_i_l_d_e_s is not a valid file or socket descriptor open
			for reading.

     [EFAULT]		_B_u_f points outside the allocated address space.

     [EINTR]		A read from a slow device was interrupted before any
			data arrived by the delivery of a signal.

     [EINVAL]		The pointer associated with _f_i_l_d_e_s was negative.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading from the file sys-
			tem.

     [EIO]		The process group is orphaned.

     [EIO]		The file is a regular file, _n_b_y_t_e is greater than 0,
			the starting position is before the end-of-file, and
			the starting position is greater than or equal to the
			offset maximum established for the open file descrip-
			tor associated with _f_i_l_d_e_s.

     [EISDIR]		An attempt is made to read a directory.

     [ENOBUFS]		An attempt to allocate a memory buffer fails.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient memory is available.

     [ENXIO]		An action is requested of a device that does not
			exist..

     [ENXIO]		A requested action cannot be performed by the device.

     The pprreeaadd() call may also return the following errors:

     [EINVAL]		The specified file offset is invalid.

     [ESPIPE]		The file descriptor is associated with a pipe, socket,
			or FIFO.

     The rreeaadd() call may also return the following errors:

     [ECONNRESET]	The connection is closed by the peer during a read
			attempt on a socket.

     [ENOTCONN] 	A read is attempted on an unconnected socket.

     [ETIMEDOUT]	A transmission timeout occurs during a read attempt on
			a socket.

     The rreeaaddvv() call may also return one of the following errors:

     [EFAULT]		Part of the _i_o_v points outside the process's allocated
			address space.

     [EINVAL]		_I_o_v_c_n_t was less than or equal to 0, or greater than
			16.

     [EINVAL]		One of the _i_o_v___l_e_n values in the _i_o_v array was nega-
			tive.

     [EINVAL]		The sum of the _i_o_v___l_e_n values in the _i_o_v array over-
			flowed a 32-bit integer.

     The rreeaadd() function call is expected to conform to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990
     (``POSIX.1'').  The rreeaaddvv() and pprreeaadd() functions are expected to conform
     to X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4, Version 2 (``XPG4.2'').

     The pprreeaadd() function call appeared in AT&T System V.4 UNIX.  The rreeaaddvv()
     function call appeared in 4.2BSD.	A rreeaadd() function call appeared in
     Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

     The sseettaauuiidd() system call sets the active audit identifier for the cur-
     rent process from the _a_u___i_d___t pointed to by _a_u_i_d.	The value of AU_DEFAU-
     DITID (-1) should not be used for _a_u_i_d.

     This system call requires an appropriate privilege to complete.

     Once the audit identifier is set to some other value than AU_DEAUDITID
     (-1) then it is immutable.  This system call may be used to set the audit
     identifier after initially setting up the audit session with the
     setaudit(2), or setaudit_addr(2) system call.

     Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the
     error.

EERRRROORRSS
     The sseettaauuiidd() function will fail if:

     [EFAULT]		A failure occurred while data transferred to the ker-
			nel failed.

     [EINVAL]		An invalid value for _a_u_i_d was used.  _a_u_i_d can be any
			value of type _a_u___i_d___t except AU_DEFAUDITID.

     [EPERM]		The process does not have sufficient permission to
			complete the operation.

     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc. in 2004.
     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.

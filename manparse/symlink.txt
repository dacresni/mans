     A symbolic link _p_a_t_h_2 is created to _p_a_t_h_1 (_p_a_t_h_2 is the name of the file
     created, _p_a_t_h_1 is the string used in creating the symbolic link).	Either
     name may be an arbitrary path name; the files need not be on the same
     file system.

     Upon successful completion, a zero value is returned.  If an error
     occurs, the error code is stored in _e_r_r_n_o and a -1 value is returned.

EERRRROORRSS
     The symbolic link succeeds unless:

     [EACCES]		Write permission is denied in the directory where the
			symbolic link is being created.

     [EACCES]		A component of the _p_a_t_h_2 path prefix denies search
			permission.

     [EDQUOT]		The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic
			link is being placed cannot be extended because the
			user's quota of disk blocks on the file system con-
			taining the directory has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]		The new symbolic link cannot be created because the
			user's quota of disk blocks on the file system that
			will contain the symbolic link has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]		The user's quota of inodes on the file system on which
			the symbolic link is being created has been exhausted.

     [EEXIST]		_P_a_t_h_2 already exists.

     [EFAULT]		_P_a_t_h_1 or _p_a_t_h_2 points outside the process's allocated
			address space.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurs while making the directory entry
			or allocating the inode.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurs while making the directory entry
			for _p_a_t_h_2, or allocating the inode for _p_a_t_h_2, or writ-
			ing out the link contents of _p_a_t_h_2.

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating
			the pathname.  This is taken to be indicative of a
			looping symbolic link.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	A component of a pathname exceeds {NAME_MAX} charac-
			ters, or an entire path name exceeds {PATH_MAX} char-
			acters.

     [ENOENT]		A component of _p_a_t_h_2 does not name an existing file or
			_p_a_t_h_2 is an empty string.

     [ENOSPC]		The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic
			link is being placed cannot be extended because there
			is no space left on the file system containing the
			directory.

     [ENOSPC]		The new symbolic link cannot be created because there
			there is no space left on the file system that will
			contain the symbolic link.

     [ENOSPC]		There are no free inodes on the file system on which
			the symbolic link is being created.

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of the _p_a_t_h_2 prefix is not a directory.

     [EROFS]		The file _p_a_t_h_2 would reside on a read-only file sys-
			tem.

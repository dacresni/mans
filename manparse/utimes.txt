     The access and modification times of the file named by _p_a_t_h or referenced
     by _f_i_l_d_e_s are changed as specified by the argument _t_i_m_e_s.

     If _t_i_m_e_s is NULL, the access and modification times are set to the cur-
     rent time.  The caller must be the owner of the file, have permission to
     write the file, or be the super-user.

     If _t_i_m_e_s is non-NULL, it is assumed to point to an array of two timeval
     structures.  The access time is set to the value of the first element,
     and the modification time is set to the value of the second element.  The
     caller must be the owner of the file or be the super-user.

     In either case, the inode-change-time of the file is set to the current
     time.

     Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the
     error.

EERRRROORRSS
     The uuttiimmeess() system call will fail if:

     [EACCES]		Search permission is denied for a component of the
			path prefix; or the _t_i_m_e_s argument is NULL and the
			effective user ID of the process does not match the
			owner of the file, and is not the super-user, and
			write access is denied.

     [EFAULT]		_p_a_t_h or _t_i_m_e_s points outside the process's allocated
			address space.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurs while reading or writing the
			affected inode.

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating
			the pathname.  This is taken to be indicative of a
			looping symbolic link.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	A component of a pathname exceeds NAME_MAX characters,
			or an entire path name exceeded PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]		The named file does not exist.

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [EPERM]		The _t_i_m_e_s argument is not NULL and the calling
			process's effective user ID does not match the owner
			of the file and is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]		The file system containing the file is mounted read-
			only.

     The ffuuttiimmeess() system call will fail if:

     [EBADF]		_f_i_l_d_e_s does not refer to a valid descriptor.

     All of the functions will fail if:

     [EACCES]		The _t_i_m_e_s argument is NULL and the effective user ID
			of the process does not match the owner of the file,
			and is not the super-user, and write access is denied.

     [EFAULT]		_t_i_m_e_s points outside the process's allocated address
			space.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading or writing the
			affected inode.

     [EPERM]		The _t_i_m_e_s argument is not NULL and the calling
			process's effective user ID does not match the owner
			of the file and is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]		The file system containing the file is mounted read-
			only.

     The uuttiimmeess() function call appeared in 4.2BSD.  The ffuuttiimmeess() function
     call first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.

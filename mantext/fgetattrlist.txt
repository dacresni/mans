     The ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() function returns attributes (that is, metadata) of file
     system objects.  ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() works on the file system object named by
     _p_a_t_h, while ffggeettaattttrrlliisstt() works on the provided file descriptor _f_d.  You
     can think of ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() as a seriously enhanced version of stat(2).
     The functions return attributes about the specified file system object
     into the buffer specified by _a_t_t_r_B_u_f and _a_t_t_r_B_u_f_S_i_z_e.  The _a_t_t_r_L_i_s_t
     parameter determines what attributes are returned.  The _o_p_t_i_o_n_s parameter
     lets you control specific aspects of the function's behavior.

     The ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() and ffggeettaattttrrlliisstt() functions are only supported by cer-
     tain volume format implementations.  For maximum compatibility, client
     programs should use high-level APIs (such as the Carbon File Manager) to
     access file system attributes.  These high-level APIs include logic to
     emulate file system attributes on volumes that don't support the calls.

     Not all volumes support all attributes.  See the discussion of
     ATTR_VOL_ATTRIBUTES for a discussion of how to determine whether a par-
     ticular volume supports a particular attribute.

     Furthermore, you should only request the attributes that you need.  Some
     attributes are expensive to calculate on some volume formats.  For exam-
     ple, ATTR_DIR_ENTRYCOUNT is usually expensive to calculate on non-HFS
     [Plus] volumes.  If you don't need a particular attribute, you should not
     ask for it.

     The _p_a_t_h parameter must reference a valid file system object.  Read,
     write or execute permission of the object itself is not required, but all
     directories listed in the path name leading to the object must be search-
     able.

     The _a_t_t_r_L_i_s_t parameter is a pointer to an _a_t_t_r_l_i_s_t structure, as defined
     by <_s_y_s_/_a_t_t_r_._h> (shown below).  It determines what attributes are
     returned by the function.	You are responsible for filling out all fields
     of this structure before calling the function.

     typedef u_int32_t attrgroup_t;

     struct attrlist {
	 u_short     bitmapcount; /* number of attr. bit sets in list */
	 u_int16_t   reserved;	  /* (to maintain 4-byte alignment) */
	 attrgroup_t commonattr;  /* common attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t volattr;	  /* volume attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t dirattr;	  /* directory attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t fileattr;	  /* file attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t forkattr;	  /* fork attribute group */
     };
     #define ATTR_BIT_MAP_COUNT 5

     The fields of the _a_t_t_r_l_i_s_t structure are defined as follows.

     bitmapcount     Number of attribute bit sets in the structure.  In cur-
		     rent systems you must set this to ATTR_BIT_MAP_COUNT.

     reserved	     Reserved.	You must set this to 0.

     commonattr      A bit set that specifies the common attributes that you
		     require.  Common attributes relate to all types of file
		     system objects.  See below for a description of these
		     attributes.

     volattr	     A bit set that specifies the volume attributes that you
		     require.  Volume attributes relate to volumes (that is,
		     mounted file systems).  See below for a description of
		     these attributes.	If you request volume attributes, _p_a_t_h
		     must reference the root of a volume.  In addition, you
		     can't request volume attributes if you also request file
		     or directory attributes.

     dirattr	     A bit set that specifies the directory attributes that
		     you require.  See below for a description of these
		     attributes.

     fileattr	     A bit set that specifies the file attributes that you
		     require.  See below for a description of these
		     attributes.

     forkattr	     A bit set that specifies the fork attributes that you
		     require.  Fork attributes relate to the actual data in
		     the file, which can be held in multiple named contiguous
		     ranges, or forks.	See below for a description of these
		     attributes.

     Unless otherwise noted in the lists below, attributes are read-only.
     Attributes labelled as read/write can be set using setattrlist(2).

     The _a_t_t_r_B_u_f and _a_t_t_r_B_u_f_S_i_z_e parameters specify a buffer into which the
     function places attribute values.	The format of this buffer is suffi-
     ciently complex that its description requires a separate section (see
     below).  The initial contents of this buffer are ignored.

     The _o_p_t_i_o_n_s parameter is a bit set that controls the behaviour of the
     functions.  The following option bits are defined.

     FSOPT_NOFOLLOW	     If this bit is set, ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() will not follow
			     a symlink if it occurs as the last component of
			     _p_a_t_h.

     FSOPT_REPORT_FULLSIZE   The size of the attributes reported (in the first
			     _u___i_n_t_3_2___t field in the attribute buffer) will be
			     the size needed to hold all the requested
			     attributes; if not set, only the attributes actu-
			     ally returned will be reported.  This allows the
			     caller to determine if any truncation occurred.

     FSOPT_PACK_INVAL_ATTRS  If this is bit is set, then all requested
			     attributes, even ones that are not supported by
			     the object or file system, will be returned.
			     Default values will be used for the invalid ones.
			     Requires that ATTR_CMN_RETURNED_ATTRS be
			     requested.

AATTTTRRIIBBUUTTEE BBUUFFFFEERR
     The data returned in the buffer described by _a_t_t_r_B_u_f and _a_t_t_r_B_u_f_S_i_z_e is
     formatted as follows.

     1.   The first element of the buffer is a _u___i_n_t_3_2___t that contains the
	  overall length, in bytes, of the attributes returned.  This size
	  includes the length field itself.

     2.   Following the length field is a list of attributes.  Each attribute
	  is represented by a field of its type, where the type is given as
	  part of the attribute description (below).

     3.   The attributes are placed into the attribute buffer in the order
	  that they are described below.

     4.   Each attribute is aligned to a 4-byte boundary (including 64-bit
	  data types).

     If the attribute is of variable length, it is represented in the list by
     an _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure, as defined by <_s_y_s_/_a_t_t_r_._h> (shown below).

     typedef struct attrreference {
	 int32_t	attr_dataoffset;
	 u_int32_t	attr_length;
     } attrreference_t;

     This structure contains a 'pointer' to the variable length attribute
     data.  The _a_t_t_r___l_e_n_g_t_h field is the length of the attribute data (in
     bytes).  The _a_t_t_r___d_a_t_a_o_f_f_s_e_t field is the offset in bytes from the
     _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure to the attribute data.  This offset will always
     be a multiple of sizeof(u_int32_t) bytes, so you can safely access common
     data types without fear of alignment exceptions.

     The ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() function will silently truncate attribute data if
     _a_t_t_r_B_u_f_S_i_z_e is too small.	The length field at the front of the attribute
     list always represents the length of the data actually copied into the
     attribute buffer.	If the data is truncated, there is no easy way to
     determine the buffer size that's required to get all of the requested
     attributes.  You should always pass an _a_t_t_r_B_u_f_S_i_z_e that is large enough
     to accommodate the known size of the attributes in the attribute list
     (including the leading length field).

     Because the returned attributes are simply truncated if the buffer is too
     small, it's possible for a variable length attribute to reference data
     beyond the end of the attribute buffer.  That is, it's possible for the
     attribute data to start beyond the end of the attribute buffer (that is,
     if _a_t_t_r_R_e_f is a pointer to the _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e___t, ( ( (char *) _a_t_t_r_R_e_f ) +
     _a_t_t_r___d_a_t_a_o_f_f_s_e_t ) > ( ( (char *) _a_t_t_r_B_u_f ) + _a_t_t_r_S_i_z_e ) ) or, indeed, for
     the attribute data to extend beyond the end of the attribute buffer (that
     is, ( ( (char *) _a_t_t_r_R_e_f ) + _a_t_t_r___d_a_t_a_o_f_f_s_e_t + _a_t_t_r___d_a_t_a_l_e_n_g_t_h ) > ( (
     (char *) _a_t_t_r_B_u_f ) + _a_t_t_r_S_i_z_e ) ).  If this happens you must increase the
     size of the buffer and call ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() to get an accurate copy of the
     attribute.

     Common attributes relate to all types of file system objects.  The fol-
     lowing common attributes are defined.

     ATTR_CMN_RETURNED_ATTRS   An _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e___s_e_t___t structure which is used to
			       report which of the requested attributes were
			       actually returned. This attribute, when
			       requested, will always be the first attribute
			       returned. By default, unsupported attributes
			       will be skipped (i.e. not packed into the out-
			       put buffer). This behavior can be over-ridden
			       using the FSOPT_PACK_INVAL_ATTRS option flag.
			       Only getattrlist(2) supports this attribute (
			       getdirentriesattr(2) and searchfs(2) do not
			       support it ).

     ATTR_CMN_NAME	       An _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure containing the name
			       of the file system object as UTF-8 encoded,
			       null terminated C string.  The attribute data
			       length will not be greater than NAME_MAX + 1.

     ATTR_CMN_DEVID	       A _d_e_v___t containing the device number of the
			       device on which this file system object's vol-
			       ume is mounted.	Equivalent to the _s_t___d_e_v field
			       of the _s_t_a_t structure returned by stat(2).

     ATTR_CMN_FSID	       An _f_s_i_d___t structure containing the file system
			       identifier for the volume on which the file
			       system object resides.  Equivalent to the
			       _f___f_s_i_d field of the _s_t_a_t_f_s structure returned
			       by statfs(2).

			       This value is not related to the file system ID
			       from traditional Mac OS (for example, the
			       _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m_I_D field of the _F_S_V_o_l_u_m_e_I_n_f_o struc-
			       ture returned by Carbon's FSGetVolumeInfo()
			       function).  On current versions of Mac OS X
			       that value is synthesised by the Carbon File
			       Manager.

     ATTR_CMN_OBJTYPE	       An _f_s_o_b_j___t_y_p_e___t that identifies the type of
			       file system object.  The values are taken from
			       _e_n_u_m _v_t_y_p_e in <_s_y_s_/_v_n_o_d_e_._h>.

     ATTR_CMN_OBJTAG	       An _f_s_o_b_j___t_a_g___t that identifies the type of file
			       system containing the object.  The values are
			       taken from _e_n_u_m _v_t_a_g_t_y_p_e in <_s_y_s_/_v_n_o_d_e_._h>.

     ATTR_CMN_OBJID	       An _f_s_o_b_j___i_d___t structure that uniquely identi-
			       fies the file system object within its volume.
			       The fid_generation field of this structure will
			       be zero for all non-root callers (effective UID
			       not 0).	This identifier need not be persistent
			       across an unmount/mount sequence.

			       Some volume formats use well known values for
			       the _f_i_d___o_b_j_n_o field for the root directory (2)
			       and the parent of root directory (1).  This is
			       not a required behaviour of this attribute.

     ATTR_CMN_OBJPERMANENTID   An _f_s_o_b_j___i_d___t structure that uniquely identi-
			       fies the file system object within its volume.
			       The fid_generation field of this structure will
			       be zero for all non-root callers (effective UID
			       not 0).	This identifier should be persistent
			       across an unmount/mount sequence.

			       Some file systems (for example, original HFS)
			       may need to modify the on-disk structure to
			       return a persistent identifier.	If such a file
			       system is mounted read-only, an attempt to get
			       this attribute will fail with the error EROFS.

     ATTR_CMN_PAROBJID	       An _f_s_o_b_j___i_d___t structure that identifies the
			       parent directory of the file system object.
			       The fid_generation field of this structure will
			       be zero for all non-root callers (effective UID
			       not 0).	Equivalent to the ATTR_CMN_OBJID
			       attribute of the parent directory.  This iden-
			       tifier need not be persistent across an
			       unmount/mount sequence.

			       On a volume that supports hard links, a multi-
			       ply linked file has no unique parent.  This
			       attribute will return an unspecified parent.

			       For some volume formats this attribute is very
			       expensive to calculate.

     ATTR_CMN_SCRIPT	       (read/write) A _t_e_x_t___e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g___t containing a
			       text encoding hint for the file system object's
			       name.  It is included to facilitate the loss-
			       less round trip conversion of names between
			       Unicode and traditional Mac OS script encod-
			       ings.  The values are defined in
			       <_C_a_r_b_o_n_C_o_r_e_/_T_e_x_t_C_o_m_m_o_n_._h>.  File systems that
			       do not have an appropriate text encoding value
			       should return kTextEncodingMacUnicode.  See DTS
			       Q&A 1173 "File Manager Text Encoding Hints".

     ATTR_CMN_CRTIME	       (read/write) A _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure containing
			       the time that the file system object was cre-
			       ated.

     ATTR_CMN_MODTIME	       (read/write) A _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure containing
			       the time that the file system object was last
			       modified.  Equivalent to the _s_t___m_t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c field
			       of the _s_t_a_t structure returned by stat(2).

     ATTR_CMN_CHGTIME	       (read/write) A _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure containing
			       the time that the file system object's
			       attributes were last modified.  Equivalent to
			       the _s_t___c_t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c field of the _s_t_a_t structure
			       returned by stat(2).

     ATTR_CMN_ACCTIME	       (read/write) A _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure containing
			       the time that the file system object was last
			       accessed.  Equivalent to the _s_t___a_t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c field
			       of the _s_t_a_t structure returned by stat(2).

     ATTR_CMN_BKUPTIME	       (read/write) A _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure containing
			       the time that the file system object was last
			       backed up.  This value is for use by backup
			       utilities.  The file system stores but does not
			       interpret the value.

     ATTR_CMN_FNDRINFO	       (read/write) 32 bytes of data for use by the
			       Finder.	Equivalent to the concatenation of a
			       _F_i_l_e_I_n_f_o structure and an _E_x_t_e_n_d_e_d_F_i_l_e_I_n_f_o
			       structure (or, for directories, a _F_o_l_d_e_r_I_n_f_o
			       structure and an _E_x_t_e_n_d_e_d_F_o_l_d_e_r_I_n_f_o structure).
			       These structures are defined in
			       <_C_a_r_b_o_n_C_o_r_e_/_F_i_n_d_e_r_._h>.

			       This attribute is not byte swapped by the file
			       system.	The value of multibyte fields on disk
			       is always big endian.  When running on a little
			       endian system (such as Darwin on x86), you must
			       byte swap any multibyte fields.

     ATTR_CMN_OWNERID	       (read/write) A _u_i_d___t containing the owner of
			       the file system object.	Equivalent to the
			       _s_t___u_i_d field of the _s_t_a_t structure returned by
			       stat(2).

     ATTR_CMN_GRPID	       (read/write) A _g_i_d___t containing the group of
			       the file system object.	Equivalent to the
			       _s_t___g_i_d field of the _s_t_a_t structure returned by
			       stat(2).

     ATTR_CMN_ACCESSMASK       (read/write) A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the access
			       permissions of the file system object.  Equiva-
			       lent to the _s_t___m_o_d_e field of the _s_t_a_t structure
			       returned by stat(2).

     ATTR_CMN_NAMEDATTRCOUNT   A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of named
			       attributes of the file system object.

     ATTR_CMN_NAMEDATTRLIST    An _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure containing a list of
			       named attributes of the file system object.  No
			       built-in file systems on Mac OS X currently
			       support named attributes.  Because of this, the
			       structure of this attribute's value is not yet
			       defined.

     ATTR_CMN_FLAGS	       (read/write) A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing file flags.
			       Equivalent to the _s_t___f_l_a_g_s field of the _s_t_a_t
			       structure returned by stat(2).  For more infor-
			       mation about these flags, see chflags(2).

			       The order that attributes are placed into the
			       attribute buffer almost invariably matches the
			       order of the attribute mask bit values.	The
			       exception is ATTR_CMN_FLAGS.  If its order was
			       based on its bit position, it would be before
			       the ATTR_CMN_NAMEDATTRCOUNT /
			       ATTR_CMN_NAMEDATTRLIST pair, however, it is
			       placed in the buffer after them.

     ATTR_CMN_USERACCESS       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the effective permis-
			       sions of the current user (the calling
			       process's effective UID) for this file system
			       object.	You can test for read, write, and exe-
			       cute permission using R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK,
			       respectively.  See access(2) for more details.

     ATTR_CMN_EXTENDED_SECURITY
			       A variable-length object (thus an _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
			       structure) containing a _k_a_u_t_h___f_i_l_e_s_e_c struc-
			       ture, of which only the ACL entry is used.

     ATTR_CMN_UUID	       A _g_u_i_d___t of the owner of the file system
			       object.	Analoguous to ATTR_CMN_OWNERID.

     ATTR_CMN_GRPUUID	       A _g_u_i_d___t of the group to which the file system
			       object belongs.	Analoguous to ATTR_CMN_GRPID.

     ATTR_CMN_FILEID	       A _u___i_n_t_6_4___t that uniquely identifies the file
			       system object within its volume.

     ATTR_CMN_PARENTID	       A _u___i_n_t_6_4___t that identifies the parent direc-
			       tory of the file system object.

     ATTR_CMN_FULLPATH	       An _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure containing the full
			       path (resolving all symlinks) to the file sys-
			       tem object as a UTF-8 encoded, null terminated
			       C string.  The attribute data length will not
			       be greater than PATH_MAX. Inconsistent behavior
			       may be observed when this attribute is
			       requested on hard-linked items, particularly
			       when the file system does not support
			       ATTR_CMN_PARENTID natively. Callers should be
			       aware of this when requesting the full path of
			       a hard-linked item.

     Volume attributes relate to volumes (that is, mounted file systems).  The
     following volume attributes are defined.

     ATTR_VOL_INFO	       For reasons that are not at all obvious, you
			       must set ATTR_VOL_INFO in the _v_o_l_a_t_t_r field if
			       you request any other volume attributes.  This
			       does not result in any attribute data being
			       added to the attribute buffer.

     ATTR_VOL_FSTYPE	       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the file system type.
			       Equivalent to the _f___t_y_p_e field of the _s_t_a_t_f_s
			       structure returned by statfs(2).  Generally not
			       a useful value.

     ATTR_VOL_SIGNATURE        A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the volume signature
			       word.  This value is unique within a given file
			       system type and lets you distinguish between
			       different volume formats handled by the same
			       file system.  See <_C_a_r_b_o_n_C_o_r_e_/_F_i_l_e_s_._h> for more
			       details.

     ATTR_VOL_SIZE	       An _o_f_f___t containing the total size of the vol-
			       ume in bytes.

     ATTR_VOL_SPACEFREE        An _o_f_f___t containing the free space on the vol-
			       ume in bytes.

     ATTR_VOL_SPACEAVAIL       An _o_f_f___t containing the space, in bytes, on the
			       volume available to non-privileged processes.
			       This is the free space minus the amount of
			       space reserved by the system to prevent criti-
			       cal disk exhaustion errors.  Non-privileged
			       programs, like a disk management tool, should
			       use this value to display the space available
			       to the user.

			       ATTR_VOL_SPACEAVAIL is to ATTR_VOL_SPACEFREE as
			       _f___b_a_v_a_i_l is to _f___b_f_r_e_e in statfs(2).

     ATTR_VOL_MINALLOCATION    An _o_f_f___t containing the minimum allocation size
			       on the volume in bytes.	If you create a file
			       containing one byte, it will consume this much
			       space.

     ATTR_VOL_ALLOCATIONCLUMP  An _o_f_f___t containing the allocation clump size
			       on the volume, in bytes.  As a file is
			       extended, the file system will attempt to allo-
			       cate this much space each time in order to
			       reduce fragmentation.

     ATTR_VOL_IOBLOCKSIZE      A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the optimal block size
			       when reading or writing data.  Equivalent to
			       the _f___i_o_s_i_z_e field of the _s_t_a_t_f_s structure
			       returned by statfs(2).

     ATTR_VOL_OBJCOUNT	       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of file sys-
			       tem objects on the volume.

     ATTR_VOL_FILECOUNT        A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of files on
			       the volume.

     ATTR_VOL_DIRCOUNT	       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of directo-
			       ries on the volume.

     ATTR_VOL_MAXOBJCOUNT      A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the maximum number of
			       file system objects that can be stored on the
			       volume.

     ATTR_VOL_MOUNTPOINT       An _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure containing the path
			       to the volume's mount point as a UTF-8 encoded,
			       null terminated C string.  The attribute data
			       length will not be greater than MAXPATHLEN.
			       Equivalent to the _f___m_n_t_o_n_n_a_m_e field of the
			       _s_t_a_t_f_s structure returned by statfs(2).

     ATTR_VOL_NAME	       (read/write) An _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure con-
			       taining the name of the volume as a UTF-8
			       encoded, null terminated C string.  The
			       attribute data length will not be greater than
			       NAME_MAX + 1.

			       This attribute is only read/write if the
			       VOL_CAP_INT_VOL_RENAME bit is set in the volume
			       capabilities (see below).

     ATTR_VOL_MOUNTFLAGS       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the volume mount flags.
			       This is a copy of the value passed to the _f_l_a_g_s
			       parameter of mount(2) when the volume was
			       mounted.  Equivalent to the _f___f_l_a_g_s field of
			       the _s_t_a_t_f_s structure returned by statfs(2).

     ATTR_VOL_MOUNTEDDEVICE    An _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure that returns the
			       same value as the _f___m_n_t_f_r_o_m_n_a_m_e field of the
			       _s_t_a_t_f_s structure returned by statfs(2).	For
			       local volumes this is the path to the device on
			       which the volume is mounted as a UTF-8 encoded,
			       null terminated C string.  For network volumes,
			       this is a unique string that identifies the
			       mount.  The attribute data length will not be
			       greater than MAXPATHLEN.

     ATTR_VOL_ENCODINGSUSED    An _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _l_o_n_g _l_o_n_g containing a bitmap of
			       the text encodings used on this volume.	For
			       more information about this, see the discussion
			       of _e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g_s_B_i_t_m_a_p in DTS Technote 1150 "HFS
			       Plus Volume Format".

     ATTR_VOL_CAPABILITIES     A _v_o_l___c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s___a_t_t_r___t structure describing
			       the optional features supported by this volume.
			       See below for a discussion of volume capabili-
			       ties.

     ATTR_VOL_UUID	       A _u_u_i_d___t containing the file system UUID.  Typ-
			       ically this will be a version 5 UUID.

     ATTR_VOL_ATTRIBUTES       A _v_o_l___a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_s___a_t_t_r___t structure describing
			       the attributes supported by this volume.  This
			       structure is discussed below, along with volume
			       capabilities.

     The following directory attributes are defined.

     ATTR_DIR_LINKCOUNT        A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of hard links
			       to the directory; this does not include the
			       historical "." and ".." entries.  For file sys-
			       tems that do not support hard links to directo-
			       ries, this value will be 1.

     ATTR_DIR_ENTRYCOUNT       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of file sys-
			       tem objects in the directory, not including any
			       synthetic items.  The historical "." and ".."
			       entries are also excluded from this count.

     ATTR_DIR_MOUNTSTATUS      A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing flags describing what's
			       mounted on the directory.  Currently the only
			       flag defined is DIR_MNTSTATUS_MNTPOINT, which
			       indicates that there is a file system mounted
			       on this directory.

     Requested directory attributes are not returned for file system objects
     that are not directories.

FFIILLEE AATTTTRRIIBBUUTTEESS
     The following file attributes are defined.

     ATTR_FILE_LINKCOUNT       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of hard links
			       to this file.  Equivalent to the _s_t___n_l_i_n_k field
			       of the _s_t_a_t structure returned by stat(2).

     ATTR_FILE_TOTALSIZE       An _o_f_f___t containing the total number of bytes
			       in all forks of the file (the logical size).

     ATTR_FILE_ALLOCSIZE       An _o_f_f___t containing a count of the bytes on
			       disk used by all of the file's forks (the phys-
			       ical size).

     ATTR_FILE_IOBLOCKSIZE     A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the optimal block size
			       when reading or writing this file's data.

     ATTR_FILE_CLUMPSIZE       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the allocation clump
			       size for this file, in bytes.  As the file is
			       extended, the file system will attempt to allo-
			       cate this much space each time in order to
			       reduce fragmentation.  This value applies to
			       the data fork.

     ATTR_FILE_DEVTYPE	       (read/write) A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the device
			       type for a special device file.	Equivalent to
			       the _s_t___r_d_e_v field of the _s_t_a_t structure
			       returned by stat(2).

     ATTR_FILE_FILETYPE        A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t that whose value is reserved.
			       Clients should ignore its value.  New volume

     ATTR_FILE_FORKCOUNT       A _u___i_n_t_3_2___t containing the number of forks in
			       the file.  No built-in file systems on Mac OS X
			       currently support forks other than the data and
			       resource fork.

     ATTR_FILE_FORKLIST        An _a_t_t_r_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e structure containing a list of
			       named forks of the file.  No built-in file sys-
			       tems on Mac OS X currently support forks other
			       than the data and resource fork.  Because of
			       this, the structure of this attribute's value
			       is not yet defined.

     ATTR_FILE_DATALENGTH      An _o_f_f___t containing the length of the data fork
			       in bytes (the logical size).

     ATTR_FILE_DATAALLOCSIZE   An _o_f_f___t containing a count of the bytes on

     ATTR_FILE_DATAEXTENTS     An _e_x_t_e_n_t_r_e_c_o_r_d array for the data fork.  The
			       array contains eight _d_i_s_k_e_x_t_e_n_t structures
			       which represent the first eight extents of the
			       fork.

			       This attributes exists for compatibility rea-
			       sons.  New clients should not use this
			       attribute.  Rather, they should use the
			       F_LOG2PHYS command in fcntl(2).

			       In current implementations the value may not be
			       entirely accurate for a variety of reasons.

     ATTR_FILE_RSRCLENGTH      An _o_f_f___t containing the length of the resource
			       fork in bytes (the logical size).

     ATTR_FILE_RSRCALLOCSIZE   An _o_f_f___t containing a count of the bytes on
			       disk used by the resource fork (the physical
			       size).

     ATTR_FILE_RSRCEXTENTS     An _e_x_t_e_n_t_r_e_c_o_r_d array for the resource fork.
			       The array contains eight _d_i_s_k_e_x_t_e_n_t structures
			       which represent the first eight extents of the
			       fork.

			       See also ATTR_FILE_DATAEXTENTS.

     File attributes are used for any file system object that is not a direc-
     tory, not just ordinary files.  Requested file attributes are not
     returned for file system objects that are directories.

     Fork attributes relate to the actual data in the file, which can be held
     in multiple named contiguous ranges, or forks.  The following fork
     attributes are defined.

     ATTR_FORK_TOTALSIZE       An _o_f_f___t containing the length of the fork in
			       bytes (the logical size).

     ATTR_FORK_ALLOCSIZE       An _o_f_f___t containing a count of the bytes on
			       disk used by the fork (the physical size).

     Fork attributes are not properly implemented by any current Mac OS X vol-
     ume format implementation.  We strongly recommend that client programs do
     not request fork attributes.  If you are implementing a volume format,
     you should not support these attributes.

     Not all volumes support all features.  The ATTR_VOL_CAPABILITIES
     attribute returns a _v_o_l___c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s___a_t_t_r___t structure (shown below) that
     indicates which features are supported by the volume.

     typedef struct vol_capabilities_attr {
	 vol_capabilities_set_t capabilities;

     The structure contains two fields, _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s and _v_a_l_i_d.  Each consists
     of an array of four elements.  The arrays are indexed by the following
     values.

     VOL_CAPABILITIES_FORMAT	      This element contains information about
				      the volume format.  See
				      VOL_CAP_FMT_PERSISTENTOBJECTIDS and so
				      on, below.

     VOL_CAPABILITIES_INTERFACES      This element contains information about
				      which optional functions are supported
				      by the volume format implementation.
				      See VOL_CAP_INT_SEARCHFS and so on,
				      below.

     VOL_CAPABILITIES_RESERVED1       Reserved.  A file system implementation
				      should set this element to zero.	A
				      client program should ignore this ele-
				      ment.

     VOL_CAPABILITIES_RESERVED2       Reserved.  A file system implementation
				      should set this element to zero.	A
				      client program should ignore this ele-
				      ment.

     The _v_a_l_i_d field contains bit sets that indicate which flags are known to
     the volume format implementation.	Each bit indicates whether the con-
     tents of the corresponding bit in the _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s field is valid.

     The _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s field contains bit sets that indicate whether a particu-
     lar feature is implemented by this volume format.

     The following bits are defined in the first element (indexed by
     VOL_CAPABILITIES_FORMAT) of the _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s and _v_a_l_i_d fields of the

     VOL_CAP_FMT_PERSISTENTOBJECTIDS  If this bit is set the volume format
				      supports persistent object identifiers
				      and can look up file system objects by
				      their IDs.  See ATTR_CMN_OBJPERMANENTID
				      for details about how to obtain these
				      identifiers.

     VOL_CAP_FMT_SYMBOLICLINKS	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      supports symbolic links.

     VOL_CAP_FMT_HARDLINKS	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      supports hard links.

     VOL_CAP_FMT_JOURNAL	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      supports a journal used to speed recov-
				      ery in case of unplanned restart (such
				      as a power outage or crash).  This does
				      not necessarily mean the volume is
				      actively using a journal.

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_JOURNAL_ACTIVE       If this bit is set the volume is cur-
				      rently using a journal for speedy recov-
				      ery after an unplanned restart.  This
				      bit can be set only if
				      VOL_CAP_FMT_JOURNAL is also set.

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_NO_ROOT_TIMES	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      does not store reliable times for the
				      root directory, so you should not depend
				      on them to detect changes, identify vol-
				      umes across unmount/mount, and so on.

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_SPARSE_FILES	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      supports sparse files, that is, files
				      which can have 'holes' that have never
				      been written to, and thus do not consume
				      space on disk.  A sparse file may have
				      an allocated size on disk that is less
				      than its logical length (that is,
				      ATTR_FILE_ALLOCSIZE <
				      ATTR_FILE_TOTALSIZE ).

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_ZERO_RUNS	      For security reasons, parts of a file
				      (runs) that have never been written to
				      must appear to contain zeroes.  When
				      this bit is set, the volume keeps track
				      of allocated but unwritten runs of a
				      file so that it can substitute zeroes
				      without actually writing zeroes to the
				      media.  This provides performance simi-
				      lar to sparse files, but not the space
				      savings.

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_CASE_SENSITIVE       If this bit is set the volume format
				      treats upper and lower case characters
				      in file and directory names as differ-
				      ent.  Otherwise an upper case character
				      is equivalent to a lower case character,
				      and you can't have two names that differ
				      solely in the case of the characters.

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_CASE_PRESERVING      If this bit is set the volume format
				      preserves the case of file and directory
				      names.  Otherwise the volume may change
				      the case of some characters (typically
				      making them all upper or all lower
				      case).  A volume that sets
				      VOL_CAP_FMT_CASE_SENSITIVE must also set
				      VOL_CAP_FMT_CASE_PRESERVING.

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_FAST_STATFS	      This bit is used as a hint to upper lay-
				      ers (specifically the Carbon File Man-
				      ager) to indicate that statfs(2) is fast
				      enough that its results need not be
				      cached by the caller.  A volume format
				      implementation that caches the statfs(2)
				      information in memory should set this
				      bit.  An implementation that must always
				      read from disk or always perform a net-
				      work transaction to satisfy statfs(2)
				      should not set this bit.

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_2TB_FILESIZE	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      supports file sizes larger than 4GB, and
				      potentially up to 2TB; it does not indi-
				      cate whether the file system supports
				      files larger than that.

				      Introduced with Darwin 8.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.4).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_OPENDENYMODES	      If this bit is set, the volume format
				      supports open deny modes (e.g., "open
				      for read write, deny write").

     VOL_CAP_FMT_HIDDEN_FILES	      If this bit is set, the volume format
				      supports the UF_HIDDEN file flag, and
				      the UF_HIDDEN flag is mapped to that
				      volume's native "hidden" or "invisible"
				      bit (e.g., the invisible bit from the
				      Finder Info extended attribute).

     VOL_CAP_FMT_PATH_FROM_ID	      If this bit is set, the volume format
				      supports the ability to derive a path-
				      name to the root of the file system
				      given only the ID of an object.  This
				      also implies that object IDs on this
				      file system are persistent and not recy-
				      cled.  Most file systems will not sup-
				      port this capability.

     VOL_CAP_FMT_NO_VOLUME_SIZES      If this bit is set the volume format
				      does not support determining values for
				      total data blocks, available blocks, or
				      free blocks, as in _f___b_l_o_c_k_s_, _f___b_a_v_a_i_l_,
				      and _f___b_f_r_e_e in the _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_t_a_t_f_s
				      returned by statfs(2).  Historically,
				      those values were set to 0xFFFFFFFF for
				      volumes that did not support them.

				      Introduced with Darwin 10.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.6).

     The following bits are defined in the second element (indexed by
     VOL_CAPABILITIES_INTERFACES) of the _c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s and _v_a_l_i_d fields of the
     _v_o_l___c_a_p_a_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s___a_t_t_r___t structure.

     VOL_CAP_INT_SEARCHFS	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports searchfs(2).

     VOL_CAP_INT_ATTRLIST	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports ggeettaattttrrlliisstt()
				      and setattrlist(2).

     VOL_CAP_INT_NFSEXPORT	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation allows this volume to be
				      exported via NFS.

     VOL_CAP_INT_READDIRATTR	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports
				      getdirentriesattr(2).

     VOL_CAP_INT_EXCHANGEDATA	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports exchangedata(2).

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_INT_COPYFILE	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports the (private and
				      undocumented) copyfile() function.
				      (This is not the copyfile(3) function.)

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_INT_ALLOCATE	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports the
				      F_PREALLOCATE selector of fcntl(2).

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_INT_VOL_RENAME	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation allows you to modify the
				      volume name using setattrlist(2).

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_INT_ADVLOCK	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports advisory lock-
				      ing, that is, the F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and
				      F_SETLKW selectors to fcntl(2).

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_INT_FLOCK		      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports whole file
				      locks.  This includes flock(2) and the
				      O_EXLOCK and O_SHLOCK flags to open(2).

				      Introduced with Darwin 7.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.3).

     VOL_CAP_INT_EXTENDED_SECURITY    If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports extended secu-
				      rity controls (ACLs).

				      Introduced with Darwin 8.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.4).

     VOL_CAP_INT_USERACCESS	      If this bit is set the volume format
				      implementation supports the
				      ATTR_CMN_USERACCESS attribute.

				      Introduced with Darwin 8.0 (Mac OS X
				      version 10.4).

     VOL_CAP_INT_MANLOCK	      If this bit is set, the volume format
				      implementation supports AFP-style manda-
				      tory byte range locks via ioctl(2).

     VOL_CAP_INT_EXTENDED_ATTR	      If this bit is set, the volume format
				      implementation supports native extended
				      attributes (see setxattr(2) ).

     VOL_CAP_INT_NAMEDSTREAMS	      If this bit is set, the volume format
				      implementation supports native named
				      streams.

     A volume can also report which attributes it supports.  This information
     is returned by the ATTR_VOL_ATTRIBUTES attribute, which returns a
     _v_o_l___a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_s___a_t_t_r___t structure (shown below).

     typedef struct attribute_set {
	 attrgroup_t commonattr; /* common attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t volattr;	 /* volume attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t dirattr;	 /* directory attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t fileattr;	 /* file attribute group */
	 attrgroup_t forkattr;	 /* fork attribute group */
     } attribute_set_t;

     typedef struct vol_attributes_attr {
	 attribute_set_t validattr;
	 attribute_set_t nativeattr;
     } vol_attributes_attr_t;

     The _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_t_r field consists of a number of bit sets that indicate
     whether an attribute is supported by the volume format implementation.
     The _n_a_t_i_v_e_a_t_t_r is similar except that the bit sets indicate whether an
     attribute is supported natively by the volume format.  An attribute is
     supported natively if the volume format implementation does not have to
     do any complex conversions to access the attribute.  For example, a vol-
     ume format might support persistent object identifiers, but doing so
     requires a complex table lookup that is not part of the core volume for-
     mat.  In that case, the ATTR_VOL_ATTRIBUTES attribute would return
     ATTR_CMN_OBJPERMANENTID set in the _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_t_r field of the
     _v_o_l___a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_s___a_t_t_r___t, but not in the _n_a_t_i_v_e_a_t_t_r field.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
     Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     Not all volumes support ggeettaattttrrlliisstt().  The best way to test whether a
     volume supports this function is to simply call it and check the error
     result.  ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() will return ENOTSUP if it is not supported on a
     particular volume.

     The ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() function has been undocumented for more than two years.
     In that time a number of volume format implementations have been created
     without a proper specification for the behaviour of this routine.	You
     may encounter volume format implementations with slightly different be-
     haviour than what is described here.  Your program is expected to be tol-
     erant of this variant behaviour.

     If you're implementing a volume format that supports ggeettaattttrrlliisstt(), you
     should be careful to support the behaviour specified by this document.

EERRRROORRSS
     ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() and ffggeettaattttrrlliisstt() will fail if:

     [ENOTSUP]		The volume does not support the query.

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of the path prefix for ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() is
			not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	A component of a path name for ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() exceeded
			NAME_MAX characters, or an entire path name exceeded
			PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]		The file system object for ggeettaattttrrlliisstt() does not
			exist.

     [EBADF]		The file descriptor argument for ffggeettaattttrrlliisstt() is not
			a valid file descriptor.

     [EACCES]		Search permission is denied for a component of the
			path prefix for ggeettaattttrrlliisstt().

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat-
			ing the pathname for ggeettaattttrrlliisstt().

     [EFAULT]		_p_a_t_h, _a_t_t_r_L_i_s_t or _a_t_t_r_B_u_f points to an invalid
			address.

     [EINVAL]		The _b_i_t_m_a_p_c_o_u_n_t field of _a_t_t_r_L_i_s_t is not
			ATTR_BIT_MAP_COUNT.

     [EINVAL]		You requested an invalid attribute.

     [EINVAL]		You requested an attribute that is not supported for
			this file system object.

     [EINVAL]		You requested volume attributes and directory or file
			attributes.

     [EINVAL]		You requested volume attributes but _p_a_t_h does not ref-
			erence the root of the volume.

     [EROFS]		The volume is read-only but must be modified in order
			to return this attribute.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
			the file system.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
     If you request any volume attributes, you must set ATTR_VOL_INFO in the
     _v_o_l_a_t_t_r field, even though it generates no result in the attribute
     buffer.

     The order that attributes are stored in the attribute buffer almost
     invariably matches the order of attribute mask bit values.  For example,
     ATTR_CMN_NAME (0x00000001) comes before ATTR_CMN_DEVID (0x00000002)
     because its value is smaller.  However, you can not rely on this ordering
     because there is one key exception: ATTR_CMN_FLAGS is placed after the
     ATTR_CMN_NAMEDATTRCOUNT / ATTR_CMN_NAMEDATTRLIST pair, even though its
     bit position indicates that it should come before.  This is due to a bug
     in an early version of Mac OS X that can't be fixed for binary compati-
     bility reasons.  When ordering attributes, you should always use the
     order in which they are described above.

     The _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure is 64-bits (two 32-bit elements) in 32-bit code,
     and 128-bits (two 64-bit elements) in 64-bit code; however, it is aligned
     on a 4-byte (32-bit) boundary, even in 64-bit code.

     Inconsistent behavior may be observed when the ATTR_CMN_FULLPATH
     attribute is requested on hard-linked items, particularly when the file
     system does not support ATTR_CMN_PARENTID natively. Callers should be
     aware of this when requesting the full path of a hard-linked item, espe-
     cially if the full path crosses mount points.

     For more caveats, see also the compatibility notes above.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     The following code prints the file type and creator of a file, assuming
     that the volume supports the required attributes.

	 err = getattrlist(path, &attrList, &attrBuf, sizeof(attrBuf), 0);
	 if (err != 0) {

	 if (err == 0) {
	     assert(attrBuf.length == sizeof(attrBuf));

	     printf("Finder information for %s:\n", path);
	     switch (attrBuf.objType) {

	 return err;

     The following code is an alternative implementation that uses nested
     structures to group the related attributes.

     The following example shows how to deal with variable length attributes.
     It assumes that the volume specified by _p_a_t_h supports the necessary

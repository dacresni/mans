     The process group of the current process is returned by ggeettppggrrpp().  The
     process group of the process identified by _p_i_d is returned by ggeettppggiidd().
     If _p_i_d is zero, ggeettppggiidd() returns the process group of the current
     process.

     Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and by terminals to
     arbitrate requests for their input: processes that have the same process
     group as the terminal are foreground and may read, while others will
     block with a signal if they attempt to read.

     This call is thus used by programs such as csh(1) to create process
     groups in implementing job control.  The ttccggeettppggrrpp() and ttccsseettppggrrpp()
     calls are used to get/set the process group of the control terminal.

     The ggeettppggrrpp() call always succeeds.  Upon successful completion, the
     ggeettppggiidd() call returns the process group of the specified process; other-
     wise, it returns a value of -1 and sets _e_r_r_n_o to indicate the error.

     ggeettppggiidd() will succeed unless:

     [ESRCH]		There is no process whose process ID equals _p_i_d.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ggeettppggrrpp() function call appeared in 4.0BSD.  The ggeettppggiidd() function
     call is derived from its usage in System V Release 4.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ggeettppggrrpp() function call is expected to conform to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990
     (``POSIX.1'').

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     This version of ggeettppggrrpp() differs from past Berkeley versions by not tak-
     ing a _p_i_d___t _p_i_d argument.	This incompatibility is required by ISO/IEC
     9945-1:1990 (``POSIX.1'').

     From the ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (``POSIX.1'') Rationale:

     4.3BSD provides a ggeettppggrrpp() function that returns the process group ID
     for a specified process.  Although this function is used to support job
     control, all known job-control shells always specify the calling process
     with this function.  Thus, the simpler AT&T System V UNIX ggeettppggrrpp() suf-
     fices, and the added complexity of the 4.3BSD ggeettppggrrpp() has been omitted
     from POSIX.1.  The old functionality is available from the ggeettppggiidd()
     function.

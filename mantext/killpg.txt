     The kkiillllppgg() function sends the signal _s_i_g to the process group _p_g_r_p.
     See sigaction(2) for a list of signals.  If _p_g_r_p is 0, kkiillllppgg() sends the
     signal to the sending process's process group.

     The sending process and members of the process group must have the same
     effective user ID, or the sender must be the super-user.  As a single
     special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be sent to any process that
     is a descendant of the current process.

     The kkiillllppgg() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the
     error.

EERRRROORRSS
     The kkiillllppgg() function will fail and no signal will be sent if:

     [EINVAL]		The _s_i_g argument is not a valid signal number.

     [EPERM]		The sending process is not the super-user and one or
			more of the target processes has an effective user ID
			different from that of the sending process.

     [ESRCH]		No process can be found in the process group specified
			by _p_g_r_p.

     [ESRCH]		The process group was given as 0 but the sending
			process does not have a process group.
